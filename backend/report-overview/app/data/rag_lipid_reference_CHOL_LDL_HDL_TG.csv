CHOL,Total Cholesterol,mg/dL,< 200,200–239,≥ 240,,,"Total cholesterol is the total amount of cholesterol in your blood (a mix of different types, including LDL and HDL).","Lower is generally better for heart health. Your result is often interpreted together with LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and your overall risk factors.",Higher total cholesterol can be associated with a higher risk of heart and blood vessel problems over time.,Low total cholesterol is less common and is usually not a problem by itself; interpretation depends on the full clinical picture.,"If your value is borderline or high, it’s reasonable to discuss it with a healthcare professional, especially if you have other risk factors."
LDL,"LDL Cholesterol (""Bad"" Cholesterol)",mg/dL,< 100 (optimal),130–159,160–189 (high); ≥ 190 (very high),,,LDL carries cholesterol through the bloodstream. Higher LDL can contribute to cholesterol buildup in blood vessel walls.,"Lower LDL is generally better. Target goals can differ based on your personal risk (for example, heart disease history).","Higher LDL may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke over time, especially when combined with other risk factors.",Lower LDL is usually favorable; your clinician may set individualized targets based on your health history.,"If your LDL is elevated, a clinician can help interpret it in context and discuss heart-healthy lifestyle options."
HDL,"HDL Cholesterol (""Good"" Cholesterol)",mg/dL,Men: ≥ 40; Women: ≥ 50,,≥ 60 is often considered protective,Men: < 40; Women: < 50,"Men: low <40, acceptable ≥40; Women: low <50, acceptable ≥50",HDL helps carry cholesterol away from the bloodstream to the liver for removal. Higher HDL is generally better.,"HDL is interpreted along with LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Sex-specific cutoffs are commonly used.","Higher HDL is often associated with lower heart disease risk, though it’s only one part of the overall picture.","Low HDL can be a risk marker for heart disease, especially if LDL or triglycerides are also high.","If HDL is low, discussing overall heart health (activity, diet, smoking status) with a clinician can be helpful."
TG,Triglycerides,mg/dL,< 150,150–199,200–499 (high); ≥ 500 (very high),,,Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood. Levels can rise after eating and may be measured fasting for accuracy.,Higher triglycerides can be linked with metabolic health and cardiovascular risk. Your clinician may interpret based on fasting status and other labs.,High triglycerides may be associated with higher cardiovascular risk; very high levels can be linked with pancreatitis risk.,Low triglycerides are usually not a concern and may reflect diet or overall metabolic status.,"If triglycerides are high, reviewing fasting status and discussing lifestyle factors with a clinician is a common next step."
